# Markdown Basics △
> *Master in making a wonderful README file for your repository.*

# What is Markdown?
- Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension.

## Why Markdown?
> Markdown is commonly used in many discussion portals (like GH Discusions, StackOverFlow) and also used in GitHub Repository's `README.md` file.
> 
> It is a light-weight syntax and helps to render many things (like images, links, headers, paragraphs, etc.).
> *README.md is a special file which tells about your respository*

## How to create a `README.md` file?
> Headover to your repository.

> Go to add *new file* tab and click *create new file*.

> Give your file name as `README.md` and whoha, you have made your first README.md file under your repository.

#### 3. Lists
**Syntax**

```
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
```
