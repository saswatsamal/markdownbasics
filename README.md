# What is Markdown?
- Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension.

## Why Markdown?
> Markdown is commonly used in many discussion portals (like GH Discusions, StackOverFlow) and also used in GitHub Repository's `README.md` file.
> 
> It is a light-weight syntax and helps to render many things (like images, links, headers, paragraphs, etc.).
> *README.md is a special file which tells about your respository*
